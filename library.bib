  ABSTRACT = {In absorption space-conditioning systems, the performance of the absorber is critical to the overall system performance, size, and first-cost. The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the significant efforts that researchers have made to mathematically model the coupled heat and mass transfer phenomena that occur during falling-film absorption. A detailed review of the governing equations, boundary conditions, assumptions, solution methods, results, and validation of these investigations is presented. This review excludes experimental work in this area, the effect of additives, and the effect of non-absorbable gases. It is shown that most work found in the literature has focused on the particularly simplified case of absorption in laminar vertical films of water-lithium bromide. Fewer researchers have considered the important situations of wavy films, turbulent films, and films on horizontal tubes. Investigations of the ammonia-water fluid pair have been generally more empirical in nature and/or restricted to vertical laminar films. This review is used to highlight key areas which need attention such as film and vapor hydrodynamics, especially the non-periodicity, instability, and recirculatory motion of waves in the vertical wall case and droplets and waves in the horizontal tube case. Also the potential interaction of the heat and mass transfer process on the film hydrodynamics, surface wetting, heat transfer in the vapor phase, and common simplifications to the governing equations should all be considered carefully. Finally, emphasis must be placed on experimental validation of the local conditions and transfer processes within the absorber, not just overall transport values. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd and IIR.

  ABSTRACT = {{\$}\backslash{\$}nNew models of film flows down inclined planes have been derived by {\$}\backslash{\$}ncombining a gradient expansion at first or second order to weighted {\$}\backslash{\$}nresidual techniques with polynomials as test functions. The {\$}\backslash{\$}ntwo-dimensional formulation has been extended to account for {\$}\backslash{\$}nthree-dimensional flows as well. The full second-order two-dimensional {\$}\backslash{\$}nmodel can be expressed as a set of four coupled evolution equations for {\$}\backslash{\$}nfour slowly varying fields, the thickness h, the flow rate q and two other {\$}\backslash{\$}nquantities measuring the departure from the flat-film semi-parabolic {\$}\backslash{\$}nvelocity profile. A simplified model has been obtained in terms of h and q {\$}\backslash{\$}nonly. Including viscous dispersion effects properly, it closely sticks to {\$}\backslash{\$}nthe asymptotic expansion in the appropriate limit. Our new models improve {\$}\backslash{\$}nover previous ones in that they remain valid deep into the strongly {\$}\backslash{\$}nnonlinear regime, as shown by the comparison of our results relative to {\$}\backslash{\$}ntravelling-wave and solitary-wave solutions with those of both direct {\$}\backslash{\$}nnumerical simulations and experiments.},

@ARTICLE{Yoshimura1996,
  ABSTRACT = {Two-dimensional surface waves were produced on a falling laminar water film by input of controlled disturbances, and the increase in the film absorption of the surrounding gas was determined at temperatures, 17.1-18.4›C. The augmentation decreases constantly with wave frequency for low Reynolds numbers Re {<} 20, whereas it constantly increases for higher Reynolds numbers Re{>} 20. Taking account of these experimental results and the numerical observations by Nagasaki and Hijikata (1990, Proceedings of the 3rd Japan Mechanical Engineering Society Symposium on Numerical Dynamics, No. 900-69, pp. 47-48) and others, we constructed a double boundary layer model, in which the mass transfer coefficient kL is expressed as , where D and fw are the diffusivity in the film and the frequency of the waves, respectively. The equation, which is derived from the penetration theory, introduces the parameter [xi] for waves sweeping highly concentrated thin layers on the surface. It was found that at constant physical properties of liquid the parameter is a function only of phase velocity, and thus increases with phase velocity},

@ARTICLE{Miyara1999,
  ABSTRACT = {Flow dynamics and heat transfer of falling liquid films with interfacial waves flowing on a vertical plate have been studied with originally proposed numerical simulation method. To discretize basic equations a staggered grid fixed on a physical space is employed. A small amplitude disturbance generated at inflow boundary develops to a solitary wave which consists of a large amplitude roll wave and small amplitude capillary waves. Instantaneous streamwise velocity profiles at the wave crest and trough are very different from a laminar flow. A circulation flow occurs in the roll wave and it affects temperature distributions, especially the strong effect is observed for high Prandtl number liquids. The interfacial wave enhances the heat transfer by two kinds of effects which are a film thinning effect and a convection effect. The dominating effect depends on the Prandtl number.},
